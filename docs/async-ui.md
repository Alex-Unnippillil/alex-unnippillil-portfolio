# Async UI Patterns

1. **Route-level Suspense**

   * Use `Suspense` and streaming for app windows/lists with skeleton UIs.

2. **Optimistic UI**

   * Update UI immediately for quick toggles and reconcile after server response.

3. **Error-aware loaders**

   * Display contextual errors with retry/backoff when network requests fail.
